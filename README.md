## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Flutter Course:

# 1.1: Flutter
- Major ways of develop mobile application: 
   - Native Apps: Two separate app and code for both platform
   - Web Apps: Html, css, javascript. Quite easy for web developers. But unable to support many native android and iOS features
   - Hybrid apps: One code base. Xamarin, Cordova, Ionic, React Native. Advance native feature not support. So Flutter provide that all features. 
- Flutter: 
  - Strongly typed language. 
  - Object-oriented language: Developed by Google
  - During app development: 
    - JIT (just in time) Compilation
       - Faster compilation time during app development
       - Faster app reload. Hot reload. 
    - AOT (Ahead Of Time) Compilation
       - While running apps on device it is much faster
    For developers, JIT helps in faster app development
    For app users, AOT helps in faster app execution
    
- Flutter is different: 
  - Faster development and execution due to JIT and AOT
  - Similar user-ex compared to Native apps like Android and iOS
  - Single code base for both android and iOS
